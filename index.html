<h1>Irish Immigration to the United States</h1>
<p class="lead">Long held as one of the most influential immigrant groups in the history of the United States, Irish people are again traversing the sea in search of better opportunities due to a floundering Irish economy. </p>

<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<p>There are a plethora of economic and social factors that contribute to the emigration rate from Ireland to the United States. Major points of influence for emigrants are a high unemployment rate, a downturn in housing values, and the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/decade-lost-as-children-in-ireland-bear-brunt-of-recession-1.1979612">end of a period of strong Irish economic activity</a>, known as the Celtic Tiger. Irish immigration tends to be concentrated on the larger East Coast cities, due to proximity to air routes back and forth to Ireland, work opportunities, and historic precedence. </p>
<p><h2>Why The Recent Influx?</h2></p>
<p>Since the end of the Celtic Tiger, <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/unemployment-rate">the unemployment rate </a> has remained high, reaching a startling 15.1% in February, 2012. This has led thousands of Irish to leave their homeland in pursuit of better economic opportunities. With a total national population of just over 4 million, the fact that emigrant totals are on the rise and are reaching nearly 100,000 per year is of great concern. </p>

<p>These economic failings, largely rooted in the value loss of the housing market and the overall downturn of the EU economy, has led to a recent uptick in Irish immigration to the United States, with a significant upswing starting in 2009, the beginning of the Irish Recession, and continuing today. </p>

<p><h2>Where have they settled?</h2></p>
<p>In keeping with historic precedents, many immigrants from Ireland have settled in the larger U.S. cities, like New York, Boston, and Chicago, as this great map courtesy of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/03/10/us/20090310-immigration-explorer.html?_r=0"> New York Times <a/> shows.</p>

<p>Additionally, with the economy in such a downturn, Irish people are beginning to stay rather than earning money and eventually going home.  There are already many U.S. states which claim Irish as the largest heritage, as this map shows.</p>

<p>Right here in New York City, there is a huge population of Irish immigrants. They are particularly concentrated in the borough of Queens, where the Woodside neighborhood is not only home to a large contingent, but an <a href="http://eiic.org"> immigration center that specifically helps Irish in America with status issues. </a> <p>
