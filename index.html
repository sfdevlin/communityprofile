<h1>Irish Immigration to the United States</h1>
<p class="lead">Long held as one of the most influential immigrant groups in the history of the United States, Irish people are again traversing the sea in search of better opportunities due to a floundering Irish economy. </p>

<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<p>In the past five to ten years, the immigration rate from Ireland to the United States has increased. The biggest impact on new emigrants from the country centers on the end of a period of strong economic activity known as the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/decade-lost-as-children-in-ireland-bear-brunt-of-recession-1.1979612">end of a period of strong Irish economic activity</a>, known as the Celtic Tiger.  With the Tiger in hibernation, many Irish are on the move.</p>
<p><h2>Why The Recent Influx?</h2></p>
<p>Since the end of the Celtic Tiger, <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/unemployment-rate">the unemployment rate </a> continues at a high clip, which topped out nearly 15% in February, 2012. This has led thousands of Irish to leave their homeland in pursuit of better economic opportunities in other Western, English speaking nations like Canada, the UK, and the United States. With a total national population of just over 4 million, emigrant totals are on the rise and are reaching nearly 100,000 per year.  Most of those leaving are young, educated Irish. </p>

<p>The Irish Recession is prompting the biggest uptick in immigration to the states in decades, and continues to rise. </p>

<p><h2>Where have they settled?</h2></p>
<p>In keeping with historic precedents, many immigrants from Ireland have settled in the larger U.S. cities, like New York, Boston, and Chicago, as this great map courtesy of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/03/10/us/20090310-immigration-explorer.html?_r=0"> New York Times <a/> shows.</p>

<p>Additionally, with the economy in such a downturn, Irish people are beginning to stay rather than earning money and eventually going home.  There are already Irish-American communities to be found in the U.S. as this map shows.  The most significant areas of "Irishness" occur on the Eastern Seaboard, largely due to proximity to airlines that provide service from Dublin and Shannon and highly populated cities with many job opportunities and long-established Irish communities.</p>

<p>Right here in New York City, there is a significant population of Irish immigrants. They are particularly concentrated in the borough of Queens, where the Woodside neighborhood is not only home to a large contingent, but an <a href="http://eiic.org"> immigration center that specifically helps Irish in America with job searches, visa updates, and getting relatives from Ireland into the country legally and safely. </a>  The below chart shows the distribution of Irish nationals in the five boroughs of New York City. <p>
