**Overview**

The Irish community in the United States has been vibrant and influential since the first major waves of migration from Ireland to the U.S. began in the mid nineteenth century.  More than 1 in 10 Americans claim some Irish ancestry, and over half the presidents of the U.S. also have some Irish background.

  The data on lesbian salaries/income/how much time they spend consuming media would be an incentive for their inclusion on more mainstream platforms, and not just on lesbian outlets. The point of our research is to go beyond just same sex marriage/LGBT rights, and to create a reason for the media to see how  the inclusion of the queer  community and not only "separate but equal platforms, in mainstream culture will have great economic advantages for these companies.

In the media, gay men are very much more prominent than gay women, both as executives and as personalities. On television, gay men may not always be represented in the best light, however they don't go through trists of bisexuality. Often television writers have women engage in bisexual relationships, which they deem as exciting surprises for their viewers.This is often demonstrated  during the infamous "sweeps week," in which television shows go all out for the highest ratings possible  for their season finale.
