**Overview**

The Irish community in the United States has been vibrant and influential since the first major waves of migration from Ireland to the U.S. began in the mid nineteenth century.  More than 1 in 10 Americans claim some Irish ancestry, and over half the presidents of the U.S. also have some Irish background.

  The data, which comes from the American Community Survey, shows that Irish Americans tend to be concentrated on the coasts, particularly in the Northeast.  This is likely due to the historical incentive for the Irish to settle in cities where there were manufacturing bases.  This is particularly true of the major hubs in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City.

When we look at a closer view of the New York metro area, we see that there are larger concentrations of Irish Americans in the suburbs surrounding New York rather than the city itself, with the exception of a few spots in Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island where current immigration is still strong.  This leads us to the conclusion that due to the fact that the Irish are one of the older immigrant groups in the United States, they have had more time to financially establish themselves and escape the city for higher income housing and job opportunities in the suburbs.
